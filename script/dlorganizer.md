## 🧠 What It Does

This script automatically organizes your `~/Downloads` folder by sorting files into subfolders based on their file type — like how Internet Download Manager (IDM) organizes files on Windows. No more messy Downloads!

## 📁 Folder Structure

Files are sorted into these folders:
- Videos
- Music
- Documents
- Archives
- Images
- Apps
- Code
- Configs
- Others

## 🚀 How To Use

1. Save the script as `dlorganizer`
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x dlorganizer
